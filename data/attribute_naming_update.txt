Attribute names update	
--------------------------

The original dataset contained a systematic error in the naming of histogram variables.
The first (leftmost) column for each histogram was falsely included in the histogram 
and the last column was falsely omitted. For example for the attributes names: 
af_000, af_001, ..., af_009, ag_000, ah_000, 
should have been:
af_000, ag_000, ..., ag_008, ag_009, ah_000,

All histogram variables were affected by this error. In the updated dataset 
this issue has been corrected.
Thanks to Ezgi Can Ozan for bringing this to our attention.
